Steps to Run the Code
To easily run the advanced lane detection code using Google Colab, follow these steps:
1.	Access the Colab Notebook:
•	Open the provided Colab notebook link to get started.
•	https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e1nLIt5CVj_mw4XA4Qo0s4FcWq5jIzo9#scrollTo=-q8W_XogtNeB
2.	Upload Training Data:
•	Upload full_CNN_train.p and full_CNN_labels.p files to the Colab environment.
3.	Build and Train the Model:
•	Click on the "Build Model" cell to construct the CNN model. You can adjust the layers and parameters to improve accuracy.
•	Train the model using the uploaded data.
•	Save the trained model in your desired format (h5, pth, or tar). In this example, the model is saved as lanemodel.h5.



4.	Run Advanced Lane Detection:
•	Ensure lanemodel.h5 is present in the Colab environment.
•	Upload your test video file.
•	Modify the code to match the name of the uploaded test video file.
5.	Execute the Code:
•	Run the cell containing the lane detection code to process the video.
6.	Comparison and Results:
•	For a comparison of different methods, click on the "Comparison" cell.
•	For image results, execute the "Lane Detection Code" cell.
•	Finally, run the "Results" cell to visualize the outcomes as it depends on the output videos generated in the previous steps.
